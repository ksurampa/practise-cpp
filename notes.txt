echo $? on UNIX
echo %ERRORLEVEL%% on Windows

g++ -o Hello HelloWorld.cpp node.cpp -Wall -std=c++0x		// C++ 11

iostream -> 1 istream and 3 ostream objects
	cin - istream
	cout - ostream
	cerr - ostream
	clog - ostream

>> & << are input and output operators
endl is manipulator also responsible for flushing the buffer to ostream along with ending the current line

Namespaces allow us to avoid inadvertant collisions between the names we define and uses of those same names inside library. All the name defined by the standard library are in the std namespace

:: -> scope operator

A block is a sequence of zero or more statments enclosed by curly braces

+= -> Compound Assignment operator

CTRL + d -> End of File in UNIX
CTRL + z -> End of File in Windows

./bookstore <infile >outfile

"."	->	Dot Operator
() 	->	Call Operator

Primitive Data types:

	Characters, integers, boolean, floating point numbers etc.,
	and special type called void

	Arithmetic types are divided into 2 categories: integral types (which include character and boolean)
	and floating-point types

Type			Meaning					Size

bool			boolean					NA
char			character				8 bits
wchar_t			wide character				16 bits
char16_t		Unicode Character			16 bits
char32_t		Unicode Character			32 bits
short			Short integer				16 bits
int			integer					32 bits (min 16 bits)
long			long integer				64 bits (min 32 bits)
long long		long integer				64 bits
float			single-precision floating-point		6 significant digits (32 bits)
double			double-precision floating point		10 significant digits (64 bits)
long double		extended-precision floating point	10 significant digits (128 bits)
